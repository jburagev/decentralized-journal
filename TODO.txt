1. When updating user type cannot be updated right away because of the smart contract interaction need to fix - events
2. Fix message service in saveFinaldecision - Editor service
3. Need to add to homepage success creating user and error
4. Need to integrate save final decition on front end in order for article to be uploaded to IPFS
5. Need to add user to backend when created in list of users

Issues:

1. If users are stored only on blockchain and all the time fetched from there can be really slow. For one user added it increase the loading time for 1 second...

Next steps and decision:
1. Should i use the temp google cloud for storing or only smart contracts with vote function
	- There will be one smart contract for Articles Authority which will keep all articles
	and for each article will be separate smart contract published with all metadata and 
	statuse. 
	- The article smart contract will contain the vote function and similar functions for making
	decisions about the article. Reviews can be saved as well as json similiar as userDID smart contracts
	- potential issue: slower for fetching articles because of the blockchain
	- idea: can use both, smart contracts and google cloud as cache for the articles. However every article will be stored on blockchain and
	will provide integrity
